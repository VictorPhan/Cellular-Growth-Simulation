###Overview

Simulation of a cellular growth modelled as a cellular automata.

###Files
* main.m runs the program
* LAYERS contains constant indices for the indexing the grid
* Other files are additional functions required to run the program

###Matlab compatibility
This program was written in Matlab R2016b, but should work with all version of Matlab. Only built-in functions are used.

###Todo:
* Create object for keeping track of lineage
* Add parameter for choosing which LAYER attribute to plot in the resulting image
* Assign better variable and function names
* Documentation for the functions and setting parameters to run the program
